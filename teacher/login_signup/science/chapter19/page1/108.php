f. Your brother studying in XII has developed the stress.<br>
<br>
<p style="color:green;"><b>ANSWER:</b></p><br><br>
a. If, I am spending more time on phones and video games, then the first thing is that I should realise that I am spending lot of time on these things. I would try to limit my usage of mobiles, video games etc. by diverting myself into other activities. These other activities could be anything like playing outdoor games, cooking or just meeting my friends. I would make a conscious effort to take out more time for social gatherings and make new friends in personal rather than on facebook or other sites. <br>
<br>
b. If, I find out that my neighbour's child is addicted to tobacco chewing, my first step would be to inform his parents. I would sit with the child and try to explain him the harmful effects of tobacco chewing. I will show him/her certain videos and pictures which highlight the damage caused by tobacco chewing. If required, we can take the child for professional advice.
<br>
c. There must be a reason for my sister to become incommunicative and my first step would be to figure out that reason. Once, I get to know the reason, I will help her in finding the solution to the problem. If required, I would look for professional help for her in the form of a psychologist. I would try to indulge her in more of social activities and things that she likes to do. I would advise her to talk to her friends and peolpe who are close to her. Being incommunicative and preferring loneliness is not a good sign, it is important to deal with it at the earliest. <br>
<br>
d. If I have free space around my house, I would use that space for various purposes like-
kitchen gardening<br>
playing outdoor games<br>
taking classes for underprivilaged students<br>
making a creative corner<br> 
planting ornamental and medicinal plants<br>
<br>
e. Snapping selfies is a kind of addiction and this addiction is not good for physical, mental or social health. If my friend is addicted to taking selfies, I would prefer talking to him and highlight the dangers of taking selfies. I would bring into his notice the various incidents which have occured due this selfie addiction.<br>
 <br>
f. There are various reasons because of which my brother may have developed stress. Most possible reason is, that he is in class XII and is worried about his board exams and his future. However, my first step would be to sit down with him and understand the cause of his stress. After understanding the cause, I would work with him to chalk out a strategy to solve his problem.
I would talk to him in a manner that promotes him to think positively and his mind gets diverted from negative thoughts. Another strategy would be to suggest him to indulge in his favourite activities.

<b>Question 7:</b><br>
What type of changes occurs in a home having chronically ill old person? How will you help to maintain good atmosphere?<br>
<br>
<p style="color:green;"><b>ANSWER:</b></p><br><br>
Having chronically ill old patients in a family affects the physical and mental state of others members of the family as well. It is not easy to handle old age people and if they are ill, it becomes all the more difficult. It not only affects the family monetarily but also drains them physically and emotionally as it is not easy to see the suffering of your loved ones. Since, it is a tough situation, it is important that each and every person of the family keeps patience and stays calm. They need to remain positive and ward off negative feelings and thoughts.
They should try to talk to the patient and share their entire day with them, even if they are not in a state of response. Just being present around them, protects them from the feeling of loneliness.<br>
