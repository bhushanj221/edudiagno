When a parent with blue eyes and parent with brown eyes pass down their genes for eye color to their offspring, this is an example of heredity.
<br><br>
The children inherit the genes that consist of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from the parents, and they may have blue or brown eyes. However, genetics is complex, and more than one gene is responsible for eye color.
Likewise, many genes determine other traits like hair color or height.
<br><br>
Heredity Definition in Biology
Heredity is the study of how parents pass down their traits to their offspring through genetics. Many theories about heredity have existed, and the general concepts of heredity appeared before people understood cells completely.
<br><br>
However, modern-day heredity and genetics are newer fields.
Although the foundation for studying genes appeared in the 1850s and throughout the 19th century, it was largely ignored until the early 20th century.
<br><br>
Heredity Examples
Punnett squares can help you understand homozygous vs. heterozygous crosses and heterozygous vs. heterozygous crosses. However, not all crosses can be calculated using Punnett squares due to their complexity.
Named after Reginald C. Punnett, the diagrams can help you predict phenotypes and genotypes for offspring. The squares show the probability of certain crosses.
<br><br>
Mendelâ€™s overall findings showed that genes transmit heredity. Each parents transfers half of his or her genes to the offspring. Parents can also give different sets of genes to different offspring. For example, identical twins have the same DNA, but siblings do not.
